  <p> <em>B.tech CSE, 2020,<strong>IIIT-Delhi</strong> </em></p>
  <p>I am a CSE undergraduate, exploring different fields of CSE. In my free time I like to listen to some of the classic synthwaves and watch some series or movies. I also like to code during my free time, like I build this little basic version of website to bring back the 90s feel.</p>

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://hike.in/">Hike Messenger</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Intern</li>
      <li>The focus of the internship was to work on a recommender system which suggests the users on hike
        some Posts that they might like and thereby give them organic content. The project uses neural
        networks and concepts of deepwalk for suggesting users better content.</li>
      <li>May, 2018–July,2018 </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Deep Blue Insights</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Intern</li>
      <li>At Deep Blue Insights the work was majorly on developing a user friendly product which can give the
      users a platform to interact with the system and find the kind of product that goes best with their
      profile. The platforms used in the project were Angular and Nodejs. There are many project under
      DBI including the chatbot, gamification component, etc</li>

  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/suyash-singh27/Netflix-Knowledge-graph">Knowledge Graph on Netflix data</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This project creates a Knowledge graph from csv data of Netflix and gives a front end to the final Knowledge Graph using a tool called pubby,
which is hosted on Tomcat Servlet.
The KG created is a 5-star linked data to Dbpedia and
geoname Knowledge Base.</li>
    <li>Jan, 2020–April,2020 </li>
    </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/cse-560-gpu-computing-2019/cuda_path_trace">GPU accelerated Path tracing</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>A Gpu based cuda program that parallelizes existing
 CPU based code for path tracing (also known as Stochastic Ray tracing). The project’s
main aim was to observe the speedup and various occupancy factors associated with the
introduction of parallelism to the standard CPU based code ,and to optimize the CUDA
code in order to get the best performance with the least memory overheads.</li>
      <li>Jan, 2019–April,2019 </li>
    </ul>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19kOUTiqMiPcK4YHuKM3MlI7COEvdUi5e/view?usp=sharing">Human Activity Recognition using Sensor Data</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Project’s main aim was to design a
 Machine Learning model which could best fit the available data for the sensor values and
accordingly classify the current postural transition of an individual using some test data
points. The data points consists of 3 sensors’ value namely Gyroscopic, accelerometer and
Proximity. It is a course Project under the course SML (Statistical Machine Learning).</li>
      <li>Jan, 2019–April,2019 </li>
    </ul>
    <li>NETWORK EMBEDDINGS FOR RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM</li>
    <ul>
      <li>An approach to create Vector embeddings for a given Heterogeneous Network (Multi-layered). The approach
majorly uses modified Supervised Random Walk technique (Deepwalk in python and Java)
to create node context which is later used to generate effective embedding.</li>
      <li>Aug, 2018–Dec,2018 </li>
    </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/suyash-singh27/ap_project">Chain Reaction Game</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>A game similar to the chain reaction game in android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuddyMattEnt.ChainReaction&hl=en_IN">(play store)</a>
         created using Java language. Contribution: GUI programming of the application
(Front-end) Project done in Advanced Programming course.</li>
      <li>Aug, 2017–Nov,2017 </li>
